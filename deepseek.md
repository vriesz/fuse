**Analysis of Alignment and Quality:**

**1. Code-Thesis Alignment:**
- **Strong Correlation** between described architectures (TTA/DDS/Fog/etc.) and implemented benchmarks
- **OODA Implementation** matches described closed-loop decision process in Figs 3.1-3.2
- **Environmental Adaptation** code implements weather/terrain models from Section 3.5
- **Gap:** Optimization implementation (`optimize_cost`) oversimplifies multi-objective formulation from Section 3.2

**2. Work Value:**
- **Novel Contribution:** First implementation of dynamically composable UAV architectures (vs static configurations)
- **Practical Impact:** 89% success rate in dynamic missions justifies adaptive approach
- **Research Bridge:** Connects theoretical OODA models with practical ROS 2/PX4 integration

**3. Formalization Quality:**
- **Strong:** Mathematical OODA formalization (Section 3.1) with clear constraint definitions
- **Improvement Opportunity:** Code would benefit from implementing the full α-β-γ-δ weight system
- **Verification Gap:** Missing formal proofs of architectural transition safety

**4. Introduction Effectiveness:**
- **Problem Statement:** Clearly establishes need for dynamic architectures (Section 1.2)
- **Solution Outline:** Prototype description (Section 1.3) accurately previews implementation
- **Contextualization:** Excellent historical framing from Boyd's OODA to modern UAV needs

**5. Problem-Solution Fit:**
- **Well-Defined Problem:** Static architectures inadequate for dynamic missions (Table 5.1 proves 89%→100% improvement)
- **Novel Solution:** Architecture-space optimization with environmental feedback (Fig 3.1)
- **Validation:** Comprehensive across simulation/HITL/field testing (Section 4.3)

**Actionable Recommendations:**

1. **Code Enhancements:**
   - Implement full multi-objective optimization from Section 3.2
   - Add formal verification for architecture transitions
   - Expand HITL testing interfaces

2. **Thesis Improvements:**
   - Add formal proofs of architectural convergence
   - Detail safety guarantees during dynamic reconfiguration
   - Compare with state-of-the-art baselines (e.g. DJI Matrice 300)

3. **Presentation:**
   - Visualize architecture space exploration process
   - Add component failure mode analysis
   - Discuss certification challenges for adaptive systems

**Conclusion:** This represents significant advancement in UAV system design, successfully bridging theoretical OODA principles with practical implementation. The work demonstrates measurable performance improvements (Tables 5.1-5.4) while maintaining academic rigor through formal modeling. With minor enhancements to code optimization and safety verification, this could set new standards for adaptive avionics architectures.
