# UAV Architecture Generation System

![Project Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x400?text=UAV+Architecture+Generation+System)

A Rust-based system for generating optimized UAV architectures based on mission constraints, with secure communications, sensor fusion, and OODA loop decision-making capabilities.

## Features

- **Constraint-based Architecture Generation**: Automatically generates UAV architectures based on mission requirements and constraints
- **Secure Communication Systems**: Supports encrypted links with key rotation and multiple communication protocols
- **Sensor Fusion**: Kalman filters and neural networks for robust sensor data processing
- **OODA Loop Implementation**: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act cycle for autonomous decision making
- **Payload Management**: Configurable payload systems for different mission types
- **Flight Control**: PID controllers with configurable parameters for different autonomy levels

## Components

### Core Modules

- **comms**: Communication systems and link management
- **engine**: Architecture generation engine
- **flight_control**: Flight controller and PID implementations
- **models**: Data models and constraints definitions
- **ooda**: OODA loop implementation
- **payload**: Payload management systems
- **sensor_fusion**: Sensor data processing and fusion

## Usage

### Basic Architecture Generation

```rust
use uav_arch_gen::models::{UavConstraints, MissionType};
use uav_arch_gen::engine::generate_architecture;

let constraints = UavConstraints {
    mission: MissionType::Surveillance,
    requires_ai: true,
    secure_comms: true,
    ..Default::default()
};

let architecture = generate_architecture(&constraints);
```

### Running OODA Cycles

```rust
use uav_arch_gen::models::architecture::UavSystems;
use uav_arch_gen::ooda::OodaLoop;

let mut uav = UavSystems::new(MissionType::Surveillance);
let mut ooda = OodaLoop::new();

// Execute OODA cycle
let cycle_time = ooda.execute_cycle(
    &mut uav.comms,
    &mut uav.payload,
    &mut uav.flight_controller
);
```

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust installed (version 1.70+ recommended)
2. Clone this repository
3. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

For hardware-in-the-loop testing (requires special setup):

```bash
cargo test --features hitl
```

## Benchmarks

Run performance benchmarks with:

```bash
cargo bench --features bench
```

## Configuration

The system is configured through the `UavConstraints` struct:

```rust
pub struct UavConstraints {
    pub mission: MissionType,
    pub swap: SWaPConstraints,
    pub autonomy_level: u8,
    pub requires_ai: bool,
    pub secure_comms: bool,
}
```

## Supported Communication Protocols

- MAVLink (v1 and v2)
- LoRa
- WiFi Direct
- Military-grade encrypted links

## Supported Payload Types

- Surveillance cameras (including thermal)
- Lidar scanners
- Cargo containers
- Custom payload configurations
